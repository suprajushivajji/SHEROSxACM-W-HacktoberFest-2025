## 🎯 What Is Hacktoberfest?

Hacktoberfest is an annual global event sponsored by DigitalOcean that encourages people to contribute to open-source software during the month of October. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  

- To participate, contributors submit **pull requests** (PRs) to **public repositories** marked as participating.  
- For a PR to count, it must be merged or approved by a maintainer. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- Repositories opt in by adding the `hacktoberfest` topic, and maintainers label issues/PRs they want help with. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  

It’s a way to celebrate open source, build your skills, and help meaningful projects.

To participate:
1. **Register** at [hacktoberfest.com](https://hacktoberfest.com/)
2. **Find repositories** tagged with the `hacktoberfest` topic  
3. **Submit pull requests (PRs)** during October  
4. Get your PRs reviewed, merged, and celebrated!
