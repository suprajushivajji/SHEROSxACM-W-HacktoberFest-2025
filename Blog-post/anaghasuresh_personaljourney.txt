Hey I am Anagha! A first semester MSCS student at northeastern university.
Living in an ever competitive world where you constantly feel like
you're fighting for your identity, things rarely seem to get easier. 
On most days its just being doubtful on whether your hardwork and recogntion are 
really deserved and wondered if really belong.I think the only way around such situations in life is mostly very ironically through it.
Letting yourself acknowledge these thoughts, sitting with them, and reflecting on why you feel this way is not just important — it’s necessary.
 It’s in that space of honest contemplation that growth begins, and where self-worth slowly starts to rebuild itself."

It’s in that space of honesty that growth really begins, and where self-worth slowly starts to rebuild itself.
When you allow yourself to be vulnerable and introspective, you start to rebuild your sense of self-worth, piece by piece.
This journey is certainly not easy. But it is most definitely real. And if you’re feeling the same — know that you’re not alone. 
Sometimes, the most courageous thing you can do is simply to feel, reflect, and keep going. In those quiet moments of self-doubt,
remember that growth is not loud — it’s steady, intentional, and deeply personal. You are becoming, even when it feels like you’re unraveling.
